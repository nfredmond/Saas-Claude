# OpenPlan Wave 1 Personalization Blurbs
_Date: 2026-02-24_

Use these as opening context lines in Email #1. Keep tone practical, specific, and non-hype.

## 1) Tehama County Transportation Commission
**Context line:**
"Given TCTC’s active regional planning and transportation program delivery role, I thought a fast corridor-analysis workflow for ATP/SS4A-style grant preparation might be useful to your team."

**Ask line:**
"Would you be open to a 20-minute fit check using one corridor your team is already evaluating?"

## 2) Plumas County Transportation Commission
**Context line:**
"For rural agencies where staff capacity is tight, we built OpenPlan to shorten the repetitive corridor-analysis cycle that usually slows grant preparation."

**Ask line:**
"If helpful, I can run a 30-day pilot on up to three Plumas corridors and share exactly what outputs your team would receive."

## 3) Calaveras Council of Governments
**Context line:**
"Because CCOG already leads transportation and GIS-informed planning work countywide, OpenPlan may fit as a speed-and-consistency layer for corridor-level grant analysis."

**Ask line:**
"I can demo a corridor upload-to-report workflow in about 15 minutes and then discuss whether a pilot is worth it."

## 4) Siskiyou County Local Transportation Commission
**Context line:**
"With SCLTC’s current planning workload, we thought a faster, auditable corridor-analysis workflow could reduce turnaround time on recurring grant-support tasks."

**Ask line:**
"Would a short call be useful to test whether this could support your next ATP/PROTECT-oriented corridor package?"

## 5) Tolowa Dee-ni’ Nation (Transportation/Planning)
**Context line (tribal-safe):**
"I’m reaching out with respect for tribal sovereignty and local priorities; we built OpenPlan to support—not replace—tribal transportation planning teams with faster corridor analysis and clear methods documentation."

**Ask line:**
"If appropriate, I’d value a brief conversation with your planning/transportation lead to see whether a small pilot could support current LRTP priorities."

## 6) Blue Lake Rancheria (Transportation/Planning)
**Context line (tribal-safe):**
"Given Blue Lake Rancheria’s transportation planning work, we wanted to share a pilot option that can produce corridor-level analysis and draft report materials quickly while keeping methods transparent."

**Ask line:**
"If you’re open to it, could you point me to the best transportation/planning lead for a 20-minute fit review?"
