# OpenPlan Pilot Conversion Kit (v1)
_Date: 2026-02-24_

## 1) Objective
Convert at least **1 of the first 3 pilots** into a paid OpenPlan subscription by proving one thing clearly:

> OpenPlan can deliver grant-ready corridor analysis in minutes, not weeks.

This kit is designed for small/rural agencies and tribal transportation teams that cannot justify $50K+ annual analytics tools.

---

## 2) Pilot Offer (Simple + Defensible)

### Pilot structure (recommended)
- **Duration:** 30 days
- **Scope:** up to 3 real corridors
- **Outputs per corridor:**
  - corridor map + metrics dashboard snapshot
  - Methods & Assumptions summary
  - draft grant-ready PDF report
- **Support:** one kickoff + one midpoint + one closeout call

### Pilot commercial terms
- **Pilot fee:** $1,500 fixed (credited toward annual subscription if converted in 30 days)
- **Conversion credit:** 100% of pilot fee applied to year-1 subscription
- **Not included:** custom model development, legal review, final grant narrative authorship

### Why this structure
- Not free (filters serious buyers)
- Low friction for public agencies
- Creates a fair bridge to recurring revenue

---

## 3) ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

### Best-fit buyer profile
- Rural county transportation commission / local transportation commission
- Tribal transportation planning or public works leadership
- Small planning/public works teams with recurring grant deadlines
- Existing need for ATP / SS4A / RAISE / PROTECT support

### Buying trigger signals
- Upcoming grant cycle within 3–6 months
- Recently awarded grant that needs defensible corridor analysis
- No in-house GIS/modeling capacity
- Prior consultant spend for technical sections >$15K

---

## 4) Core Value Proposition (Client-Safe Language)
OpenPlan helps agencies produce **auditable, grant-support analysis** quickly by combining corridor geometry, public datasets, and transparent scoring.

### Plain-English promise
- Faster time-to-first-draft analysis
- Lower consultant dependence for repetitive technical sections
- Better continuity between planning cycles

### AI disclosure (required)
AI is used to accelerate drafting and synthesis. Final interpretations and deliverables are reviewed and approved by qualified staff before client use.

## 5) First-Contact Messaging

### One-line opener
"We built OpenPlan so small and rural agencies can generate defensible corridor analysis for ATP/SS4A/RAISE without enterprise software pricing."

### 3-bullet hook
- Corridor upload → metrics + map + narrative in one workflow
- Methods/assumptions are transparent and auditable
- Pilot fee is credited 100% toward subscription on conversion

---

## 6) Outreach Sequence (14-Day)

### Day 1: Email #1 (problem/fit)
- Focus: grant deadline pressure + cost of repetitive analysis

### Day 3: Follow-up #1
- Share 2-sentence example outcome and pilot structure

### Day 7: Follow-up #2
- Offer 20-minute fit call with corridor examples

### Day 10: Call attempt / voicemail
- "Worth a short look before next grant cycle"

### Day 14: Final touch
- Close loop politely and invite re-open before upcoming grant deadlines

---

## 7) Discovery Call Script (20 minutes)

1. **Context (3 min):** current grant pipeline and deadlines
2. **Current workflow (5 min):** where analysis bottlenecks happen
3. **Demo walk-through (7 min):** corridor in → results/report out
4. **Pilot fit test (3 min):** pick 1–3 real corridors
5. **Commercial close (2 min):** pilot terms + conversion credit

### Qualification gates (must pass)
- Has real corridor candidates now
- Has a named decision-maker
- Has budget authority or clear procurement path

---

## 8) Pilot Success Criteria (for conversion)
A pilot should convert when all criteria are met:

- Time-to-first-insight under 15 minutes for at least one corridor
- Agency confirms outputs are usable for real grant prep workflow
- Methods & assumptions are acceptable to staff reviewers
- At least one internal champion agrees to adoption plan

---

## 9) Conversion Offer (Post-Pilot)

### Standard subscription options
- **Starter:** $599/month
- **Professional:** $1,499/month
- **Enterprise:** custom annual

### Conversion deadline
- Conversion credit valid for 30 days after pilot closeout

### Closeout artifacts to send within 48 hours
- Pilot summary memo
- Corridor deliverables package
- Subscription recommendation (Starter vs Professional)
- Implementation plan (first 30 days)

---

## 10) Objection Handling (Short Form)

### "We can’t add another tool right now"
Response: Start with Starter tier and use it only for upcoming grant corridors. Pilot fee credit reduces first-year risk.

### "We already have consultants"
Response: OpenPlan can reduce repetitive analyst time and let consultants focus on strategy and local process.

### "We need defensibility"
Response: Methods & assumptions are explicitly documented; outputs are reviewed before submission use.

---

## 11) Ethics + Quality Gate (Required Before External Sending)
Before sending external pilot proposals:

- Claims are specific and non-inflated
- Pricing and exclusions are explicit
- AI role is disclosed in plain language
- No sensitive client data appears in examples
- Tribal and disadvantaged community impacts are addressed transparently

If any item fails, revise before sending.
