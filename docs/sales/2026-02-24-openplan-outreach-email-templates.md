## Template A — Initial Outreach (Short)

Subject: Corridor analysis support for upcoming [ATP/SS4A/RAISE] work

Hi [Name],

I run Nat Ford Planning & Analysis, and we built **OpenPlan** to help small/rural agencies produce auditable corridor analysis quickly for grant development.

If useful, I can show a 15-minute walkthrough using one of your real corridors. The pilot format is simple: 30 days, up to 3 corridors, and a fixed fee credited toward subscription if it’s a fit.

Would you be open to a short call next week?

Best,
Nathaniel Ford Redmond

## Template B — Follow-Up #1 (Value + Proof)

Subject: Re: Corridor analysis support for [Agency]

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up in case this is timely for your grant pipeline.

OpenPlan is designed to produce corridor-level outputs that planning teams can actually use:
- map + metrics summary
- methods/assumptions transparency
- draft report package for internal grant prep

This is not a replacement for agency judgment or final review; it is a speed + consistency layer for repetitive technical sections.

If a quick demo is useful, I can share times for a 20-minute fit check.

Best,
Nathaniel

## Template C — Final Touch (Polite Close Loop)

Subject: Close loop — OpenPlan pilot support

Hi [Name],

I’ll close the loop for now.

If your team has upcoming corridor work for ATP/SS4A/RAISE/PROTECT and wants a faster analysis workflow, I’m happy to reconnect when timing is better.

Either way, wishing your team a strong grant cycle.

Best,
Nathaniel
