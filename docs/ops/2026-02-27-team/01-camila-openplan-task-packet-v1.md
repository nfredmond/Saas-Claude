# OpenPlan — Camila Task Packet v1

- **Date Issued (PT):** 2026-02-27
- **Owner:** Camila
- **Role:** Urban Designer / Expert Graphic Designer
- **Priority:** P0 (supports OpenPlan top-priority execution)
- **Prepared by:** Elena Marquez (Principal Planner)
- **Status:** ACTIVE

## 1) Mission
Create a production-ready visual foundation for OpenPlan that is clear, trusted by planning professionals, and implementation-ready for engineering.

## 2) Outcomes Required
1. **Consistent visual language** across OpenPlan’s highest-visibility product surfaces.
2. **Design system clarity** so components can be implemented without ambiguity.
3. **Demo/brand readiness** for external-facing screenshots and near-term sales storytelling.

## 3) Deliverables (v1)

### A. Visual Direction One-Pager
Define and document:
- Core palette (light/dark) with accessibility-conscious contrast intent
- Typography hierarchy (headline/body/caption)
- Spacing and layout rhythm
- Iconography and map-style guidance
- "Do / Don’t" examples for consistency

### B. Core UI Component Style Set
Design and spec the following components and states:
- Buttons (primary/secondary/ghost/destructive)
- Cards and panels
- Tables and filter bars
- Status chips/badges
- Alerts and empty states
- Form controls (input/select/textarea/error/success)

Include: default, hover, active, focus, disabled, error, success states.

### C. Priority Screen Polish Pass (Top 5)
Prepare annotated design pass for:
1. Dashboard
2. Scenario comparison
3. Report/export surface
4. Map/results view
5. Onboarding/workspace flow

Each screen pass must include:
- Before/after rationale
- Hierarchy and clarity improvements
- Implementation notes for engineering

### D. Brand Asset Mini-Pack (OpenPlan)
Create:
- Refined lockup usage notes
- 3 social/demo cover graphics
- 1 executive-ready screenshot template (proposal/deck use)

### E. Engineering Handoff Spec
Provide a concise implementation handoff including:
- Tokens (colors/spacing/type)
- Component naming conventions
- Asset paths and usage notes
- "Ready for implementation" checklist

## 4) Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Product UI visual quality and consistency
- Design-system-level decisions needed for immediate engineering implementation
- Presentation polish that improves client confidence

### Out of Scope (for v1)
- Net-new feature definition or product roadmap changes
- Large UX re-architecture requiring backend/API changes
- Marketing website redesign outside OpenPlan product surfaces

## 5) Timeline and Checkpoints
- **Kickoff:** immediate upon receipt
- **Checkpoint 1 (+24h):** Visual direction + component draft
- **Checkpoint 2 (+48h):** Full v1 packet + engineering handoff

## 6) Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
- Clear visual consistency across the 5 priority screens
- Accessibility-conscious color/contrast choices documented
- No decorative clutter; planner-first readability upheld
- Handoff details are explicit enough for direct implementation
- Assets and specs are organized and versioned for team reuse

## 7) Check-In Protocol (Standing)
Camila follows the same delegation/check-in accountability standard used across active employees:
- Daily progress update (what shipped / what is next / blocker status)
- Blockers escalated within 24 hours
- Decision requests phrased in decision-grade format (options + recommendation)

## 8) Reporting Format (required)
Use this format in each check-in:
- **Completed:**
- **In Progress:**
- **Next 24h:**
- **Blockers / Decisions Needed:**
- **ETA Confidence:** High / Medium / Low

## 9) Delivery Location
Store outputs under `openplan/docs/ops/2026-02-27-team/` and/or a clearly labeled sibling design folder, with final index links in this packet.
