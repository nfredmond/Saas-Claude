# 23-6 — Board/Council Memo Snippet Templates (Map-Evidence Linked)

Date: 2026-02-28 (PT)  
Owner: Owen Park (Associate Planner)

Use: drop-in snippets for agenda covers, staff memos, and board packets with direct map evidence references.

## 1) Decision Recommendation Snippet
**Recommended action:** Approve `[ACTION]` for `[CORRIDOR/AREA]` and direct staff to advance `[PHASE NEXT STEP]`.  
**Evidence basis:** Maps `[MAP_ID_1]` and `[MAP_ID_2]` identify `[RISK/ACCESS FINDING]`, supporting this recommendation.

## 2) Fiscal/Delivery Snippet
Planning estimate for Phase `[X]` is `[RANGE]`, subject to field verification and design refinement.  
Map-based prioritization in `[MAP_ID]` indicates this location yields `[SAFETY/ACCESS BENEFIT]` relative to peer segments.

## 3) Equity/Access Snippet
The action prioritizes improvements where mapped indicators (`[FIELD_1]`, `[FIELD_2]`) show higher transportation burden.  
Reference maps: `[MAP_ID]`, `[MAP_ID]`.

## 4) Risk/Limitation Snippet (required)
These maps are planning-level decision aids and not survey/engineering construction documents.  
Data limitations are documented in `[APPENDIX_ID]`; updates will be incorporated after technical verification.

## 5) Grant Readiness Snippet
The proposed scope is grant-ready for `[PROGRAM]` because mapped evidence demonstrates `[ELIGIBILITY/SCORING FACTOR]` and a phased delivery path tied to `[IMPLEMENTATION PLAN REF]`.

---

## Motion-ready council action pattern
Adopt `[CONCEPT/ACTION]`; authorize `[PHASE 1 SCOPE]` at a planning estimate of `[RANGE]`; and direct staff to return with `[PERFORMANCE/TECHNICAL UPDATE]` before authorizing `[NEXT PHASE]`.
