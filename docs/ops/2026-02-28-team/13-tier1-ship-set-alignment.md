- **Date/Time (PT):** 2026-02-28 02:12
- **Prepared by:** Elena (Principal Planner)
- **Input source:** `agents/team/associate-planner/pdf_polish_inventory_2026-02-28.md`

## Tier 1 Ship Set (aligned)

### A) Urban Design Council/Client Pair (Primary)
1. `agents/team/urban-design-expert/releases/2026-02-28-tier1-premium/tier1_old_mill_premium_client_brief_v1.pdf`
2. `agents/team/urban-design-expert/releases/2026-02-28-tier1-premium/tier1_old_mill_premium_council_cover_v1.pdf`

### B) Capability One-Pager (Primary)
3. `agents/team/urban-design-expert/releases/2026-02-28-tier1-premium/tier1_natford_capability_premium_v1.pdf`

## Legacy Source Mapping (reference only)
- `old_mill_main_street_v0_5_client_clean_slide_ready.pdf` → replaced by `tier1_old_mill_premium_client_brief_v1.pdf`
- `old_mill_main_street_v0_5_council_agenda_cover.pdf` → replaced by `tier1_old_mill_premium_council_cover_v1.pdf`
- `NatFord_CapabilityStatement_Designed.pdf` / `capability_statement_final.pdf` / `NFPA_Capability_OnePager.pdf` → superseded by `tier1_natford_capability_premium_v1.pdf` for this sprint lane

## Release Gate Status
- **Urban design pair:** CONDITIONAL (must-fix edits required before external release)
- **Capability premium one-pager:** CONDITIONAL (contact/disclosure cleanup required)

## Must-Fix Gate (from principal review)
1. Resolve Concept B decision-logic traceability in comparison panel.
2. Convert council action language to motion-ready format.
3. Add direct contact channel + disclosure hygiene on capability sheet.

## Immediate next step
Camila returns v1.1 on all three Tier 1 PDFs for final principal sign-off.
