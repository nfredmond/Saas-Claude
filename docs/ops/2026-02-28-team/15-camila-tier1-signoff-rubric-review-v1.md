- **Rubric source:** `agents/team/associate-planner/pdf_polish_review_rubric_v1.md`
- **Scope reviewed:**
  - `tier1_old_mill_premium_client_brief_v1`
  - `tier1_old_mill_premium_council_cover_v1`
  - `tier1_natford_capability_premium_v1`

## Rubric Score (100 total)
- Visual hierarchy & layout clarity (20): **18**
- Typography consistency/readability (15): **12**
- Non-technical comprehension (20): **16**
- Brand consistency/professional finish (15): **13**

- Export quality (spacing/margins/contrast/print-readiness) (15): **13**

**Total: 83 / 100**

## Red-line Fail Check
- Unexplained jargon in headline/recommendation: **PASS**
- Ambiguous decision ask: **FAIL** (council action language not fully motion-ready)
- Inconsistent brand colors/type across pages: **PASS**
- Low-contrast/crowded readability blockers: **PASS**

## Must-Fix (blocking)
1. **Concept comparison decision logic mismatch (client brief).**
   - Recommendation selects Concept B, but current A/B/C scoring display does not clearly justify B.
   - Fix: add weighted decision lens and explicit “why B” rationale (or correct values).

2. **Council recommended action ambiguity.**
   - Not yet procedural enough for council motion language.
   - Fix: convert to explicit motion-ready sentence with authorization scope + return trigger.

3. **Capability one-pager contact/disclosure gap.**
   - Website-only contact is insufficient for executive handoff.
   - Fix: add direct email/phone; include synthetic/mock disclosure if applicable.

## Should-Fix
1. Add methods/assumptions micro-strip on brief + council cover.
2. Slightly increase dense body copy legibility (line-height/size).
3. Restore explicit next-step panel in premium brief.
4. Standardize Phase 1 terminology across all three documents.

## Good-to-Go
1. Premium visual hierarchy and professional polish are strong.
2. Recommendation-first framing supports fast executive scan.
3. Council/client readability is high with minimal technical clutter.
4. Export presentation quality is near release-ready.
