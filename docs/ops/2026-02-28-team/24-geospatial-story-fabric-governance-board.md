# Consolidated Execution Board — Lane 23 (Geospatial Story Fabric) + P0 Provisioning

- **Date (PT):** 2026-02-28
- **Coordinator:** Elena Marquez (Principal Planner)
- **Priority rule:** P0 paid-access provisioning reliability remains primary; Lane 23 runs as P2 innovation in remaining capacity.
- **Canonical lane doc:** `openplan/docs/ops/2026-02-28-team/23-geospatial-story-fabric-lane.md`

## Checkpoint Cadence (Tonight, PT)
1. **8:30 PM** — Owner checkpoint #1 (status + blockers + evidence paths)
2. **9:30 PM** — P0 paid-access reliability gate memo (READY/HOLD)
3. **10:15 PM** — Lane 23 consolidation checkpoint (P2 progress + carry-forward blockers)
4. **10:30 PM** — Consolidated nightly wrap to COO (P0 outcome + P2 board state)

## Required Update Format (mandatory for each owner)
- **Done**
- **In Progress**
- **Blockers / Decisions Needed**
- **ETA Confidence** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Evidence Paths** (repo path(s), run logs, screenshot path(s), test output path(s), PR path)

## Owner Board (Tonight)

| Owner | Lane | Tonight Scope | ETA | Current Blockers | Evidence Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Iris (Expert Programmer) | **P0 primary** | Deterministic workspace-bound purchase + billing mutation path hardening; mismatch/idempotency protections; tests + notes | 9:00 PM | Deterministic provisioning path not fully closed | PR path, migration/update notes path, test output path, sample webhook event IDs |
| Iris (Expert Programmer) | P2 Lane 23 | `story-pack` orchestration scaffold plan and command contract draft (after P0 critical path) | 10:15 PM | CARTO CLI not installed/auth; QGIS integration path undecided | design doc path + command spec path |
| Priya (GIS Expert) | P2 Lane 23 | QGIS automation baseline decision (CLI vs MCP), QA rubric seed (CRS/legend/readability/contrast/metadata) | 10:00 PM | No QGIS MCP configured; toolchain baseline not documented | rubric path + baseline decision note path |
| Camila (Urban Design) | P2 Lane 23 | Visual spec draft for report/web/motion map consistency | 10:00 PM | Awaiting final map output contract from Iris/Priya | style-spec path + sample references path |
| Owen (Associate Planner) | P2 Lane 23 | Narrative template mapping map outputs to council/grant language | 10:00 PM | Depends on manifest field list + QA gate headings | template path + checklist path |
| Mateo (Assistant Planner) | P2 Lane 23 | Reproducibility + artifact packaging matrix for `report/web/motion/manifest` outputs | 10:00 PM | Depends on story-pack output folder contract | matrix path + verification log path |
| Elena (Principal Planner) | Cross-lane governance | Run cadence, synthesize blocker decisions, issue consolidated outcome to COO | 10:30 PM | Waiting on owner evidence submissions | decision memo path + consolidated board update |
| Bart (COO) | Approval | GO/NO-GO on P0; lane-priority override if needed | Post 10:30 PM | None | approval note/session log |

## Active Cross-Lane Blockers (as of now)
1. P0 deterministic workspace-bound provisioning path still open (canonical lock).
2. QGIS toolchain not installed yet (`qgis_process` absent); MCP intentionally deferred to phase 2 after CLI baseline.
3. CARTO CLI install path completed (v0.1.2); org auth (`carto auth login`) still pending.
4. `make story-pack` skeleton now added; QA gate automation still pending.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Collect 8:30 PM evidence-based updates from all owners.
2. Execute 9:30 PM P0 gate memo using file 22 template.
3. Publish 10:30 PM consolidated nightly outcome with explicit carry-forward blockers.
