# 23-5 — Geospatial Policy/Grant Narrative Template

Date: 2026-02-28 (PT)  
Owner: Owen Park (Associate Planner)  
Lane: 23 Geospatial Story Fabric

Purpose: map generated GIS assets to decision-grade policy and grant language with explicit evidence fields.

## A) Narrative block template (copy/paste)

### 1) Need Statement (map-evidenced)
`[JURISDICTION]` faces documented transportation risk and access constraints in `[CORRIDOR/AREA]`.  
**Map evidence:** `[MAP_ID]` shows `[KEY OBSERVATION]` using `[DATASET + YEAR]` at `[GEOGRAPHY SCALE]`.

### 2) Equity + Access Context
Priority populations in `[AREA]` experience disproportionate burden related to `[SAFETY / ACCESS / RELIABILITY ISSUE]`.  
**Map evidence:** `[MAP_ID]` + `[INDICATOR FIELD(S)]` indicate `[INTERPRETATION]`.

### 3) Proposed Action Link
The recommended action (`[PROJECT/PROGRAM ACTION]`) directly addresses mapped constraints by `[MECHANISM]`.  
**Traceability:** action is linked to `[MAP_ID]`, `[TABLE/FIGURE ID]`, and `[ASSUMPTION_ID if applicable]`.

### 4) Funding/Scoring Relevance
This proposal aligns with `[PROGRAM: ATP/SS4A/RAISE/PROTECT/etc.]` criteria for `[SAFETY/EQUITY/RESILIENCE/DELIVERY READINESS]`.  
**Map evidence in scoring narrative:** `[MAP_ID + METRIC]` supports `[SCORING CLAIM]`.

### 5) Risk + Limitation Note (required)
Map outputs are planning-level and subject to field/engineering verification.  
Known data limitations: `[LIMITATION SUMMARY]`.

## B) Asset-to-language mapping table

| Asset ID | Asset Type | Core claim it supports | Policy/grant section | Confidence | Citation tag |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MAP-01` | Choropleth / corridor heat map | `{{INSERT CLAIM}}` | Need / Existing Conditions | High/Med/Low | `[SRC-##]` |
| `MAP-02` | Risk hotspot map | `{{INSERT CLAIM}}` | Safety Justification | High/Med/Low | `[SRC-##]` |
| `MAP-03` | Access gap map | `{{INSERT CLAIM}}` | Equity/Access | High/Med/Low | `[SRC-##]` |

---

## C) Quality gate for narrative use
- [ ] Every major claim references at least one map asset + source ID.
- [ ] No map claim exceeds evidence confidence level.
- [ ] Policy/grant language remains plain-English and non-exaggerated.
- [ ] Limitations/disclosure line is present.
- [ ] Outreach outcomes are not fabricated.
