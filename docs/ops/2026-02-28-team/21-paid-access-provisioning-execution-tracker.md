# Paid-Access Provisioning — Execution Tracker (One-Page)

- **Date (PT):** 2026-02-28
- **Priority Block:** COO / Nathaniel — implement paid-access provisioning system
- **Goal:** Every paid customer gets clear onboarding and correct access tied to purchaser email + workspace.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Success Criteria (today)
1. Checkout/webhook flow binds paid status to the correct workspace and purchaser email.
2. Onboarding message + first-step instructions are clear and sent to the purchaser email path.
3. Access verification checks confirm purchaser can enter the correct workspace with expected plan entitlements.
4. Edge cases (email mismatch, duplicate Stripe customer, missing workspace mapping) have deterministic handling.

## Owner Assignments + ETA (today, PT)

### 1) Engineering provisioning implementation
- **Owner:** Iris (Expert Programmer)
- **Scope:**
  - Finalize purchaser-email + workspace binding through checkout/webhook metadata.
  - Enforce deterministic update path for `subscription_status`, `subscription_plan`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`.
  - Add/confirm safeguards for mismatch/fallback states.
- **Deliverables:** implementation PR + migration/update notes + test results.
- **ETA:** **8:30 PM PT**

### 2) Provisioning QA gate + edge-case matrix
- **Owner:** Owen (Associate Planner)
- **Scope:**
  - Build PASS/HOLD matrix for paid-access provisioning outcomes.
  - Validate required scenarios: success path, purchaser-email mismatch, duplicate payment event, retry/idempotency.
- **Deliverables:** concise QA gate checklist + PASS/HOLD recommendation.
- **ETA:** **9:00 PM PT**

### 3) Onboarding clarity + purchaser-facing flow
- **Owner:** Mateo (Assistant Planner)
- **Scope:**
  - Draft onboarding copy and first-login instructions tied to purchaser email/workspace.
  - Create support fallback text when billing succeeds but access appears delayed.
- **Deliverables:** onboarding copy block + support fallback script + handoff notes.
- **ETA:** **8:45 PM PT**

### 4) Integration governance + final release call
- **Owner:** Elena (Principal Planner)
- **Scope:**
  - Coordinate lane synchronization, resolve blockers, and issue final go/no-go packet.
  - Confirm purchaser-email/workspace linkage is explicit in runbook language.
- **Deliverables:** final decision memo (READY/HOLD), blocker list (if any), next-step routing.
- **ETA:** **9:30 PM PT**

### 5) Approval authority
- **Owner:** Bart (COO)
- **Scope:** approval/override of final go-no-go recommendation.
- **ETA:** **Tonight, post 9:30 PM PT checkpoint**

## Active Dependencies
- Stripe checkout + webhook pipeline remains healthy.
- Required env/config remains active in production.
- Workspace membership roles (`owner/admin`) are correctly enforced.

## Current Risks (watch)
- Purchaser email differs from existing workspace owner email.
- Duplicate or delayed webhook events causing stale status.
- Customer charged but entitlement update delayed without clear onboarding guidance.

## Tonight Checkpoint Format
- **Done**
- **In Progress**
- **Blockers / Decisions Needed**
- **ETA Confidence (High/Medium/Low)**
